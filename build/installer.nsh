; Extra NSIS steps for the Sahne Plus installer (included by electron-builder, see package.json "build.nsis.include").
; Uninstall: remove the "run at Windows login" entry the app registers (app.setLoginItemSettings, name "SahnePlus"),
; so nothing of the program is left behind in the registry. Application data in Documents\Sahne Plus is kept on purpose.
