# Contributing to Sahne ProMax

Thanks for helping. Sahne ProMax is an independent Sahne+ fork with no runtime npm dependencies; please keep it that way.

## Ground rules

- **Security issues are never reported in public issues.** Use the private reporting route in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **No new runtime dependencies** without a discussion first. The application deliberately uses only Node built-ins and Electron; the zero-dependency design is part of its security posture.
- **Never commit secrets or personal data**: no KickBot widget URLs, `config.json`, media files, logs, or channel names in code, tests, fixtures or screenshots. `.gitignore` blocks the usual files; check `git diff --cached` before committing.
- Keep user-facing text in Persian consistent with the existing UI wording; code, comments and commit messages are in English.

## Development setup

```bash
npm ci            # installs Electron 43 and electron-builder (dev only)
npm start         # runs the app from source
npm test          # automated unit and integration tests
npm run dist      # builds the Windows installer into dist/
```

To run a second instance without touching your real data, point it at an empty folder with its own port:

```bash
set SAHNE_PLUS_DATA_DIR=C:\path\to\test-data
# put {"port":7799,"app":{"autostart":false}} into C:\path\to\test-data\config.json first
npm start
```

Test instances do not touch Meld Studio layers and do not register autostart.

## Project layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `electron/main.js` | Electron main process: window, tray, autostart, IPC, DPAPI secret store, hosts the server |
| `electron/preload.js` | the only bridge exposed to the page (`window.sahne`) |
| `server/server.js` | loopback HTTP + SSE server, KickBot / Kick / exchange-rate clients, alert queue |
| `public/app.*` | controller UI |
| `public/overlay.*` | Browser Source page (OBS / Meld Studio) |
| `public/legal/` | documents shown on the About page |
| `test/` | tests run by `npm test` |
| `docs/` | data-flow audit, release readiness, release notes, Persian guide |
| `build/` | icon sources and rendered icons |

## Code style

JavaScript is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) (settings in `.prettierrc`, 120 columns, single quotes). Run `npm run format` before committing; CI runs `npm run format:check`. There is no runtime dependency and none should be added.

## Pull requests

1. Open an issue first for anything bigger than a bug fix, so the design can be discussed.
2. One change per PR; describe what changed and why, and how you tested it.
3. `npm test` must pass. If you touch `server.js` validation or the overlay renderer, add a test.
4. Do not change the security defaults (`contextIsolation`, `sandbox`, fuses, Host/Origin checks, CSP) without explaining the threat model.
5. Do not add analytics, telemetry, crash reporting, auto-update or any new network destination without a discussion; [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and [docs/DATA_FLOW.md](docs/DATA_FLOW.md) must be updated in the same PR when network behaviour changes.
